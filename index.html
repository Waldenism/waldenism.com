             Hey, I'm Chris, many also call me by my last name, Walden. I am a Hoosier/Californian hybrid. I was born in Carmel, IN a suburb of Indianapolis, and have been an East Bay boy since 2011. Just in the same way I link these unrelated places, I am an aspiring polymath. I aspire for high competency across unrelated fields. I seek to develop greater capacity in all areas of accomplishment: intellectual, artistic, social, and physical. I use meditation, creation, and exercise to hack my brain, to increase learning. Let me tell you about some of my life's interests: running, cycling, and fitness. I was a high performance track athlete for 10+ years and still push my body. Music (as a creator) I play the Harp, I dabble in ukulele, theory, composition, production, keyboards, DJ, synthesizers, and hip-hop. Music (as a consumer) again as a link between worlds I listen to a wide range of genres including but not limited to: electronic, video game music, hip-hop, progressive house, reggae, classical, and Indian classical. My favorites acts are Daft Punk, Migos, and Bach. I know a thing or two about finance, business, government, politics, law, arguments, justice, logic, philosophy, chess, astrophysics/cosmology, zoology, evolutionary biology, mycology, physiology/anatomy, web design, arcade hardware, electronic engineering, computer science, Rubik's Cubes and other algorithmic puzzles, table tennis, NBA, skateboarding camping/outdoors, wood working/wood carving, and coffee. I am always learning and getting into new things and revisiting old.
